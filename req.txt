    - User registration
    - User login
    - Package table in admin panel only
    - All users could add to subscribe to more than one package
    - Subscription by make order with one or more package

You are requested to:

1. Create simple Rest APIs endpoints for:
    - Registration (DONE)
    - Login        (DONE)

    - Add Package model and show it in admin (product fields are: name, price)
    - Get Packages and the query should:
        - Order by price
        - search by name
    - create subscription with one or more packages
    - get user subscriptions

2. Use linter for your code (ex: flake8).

3. Add a Readme file containing instructions to run your code
Notes:
- Adding simple test cases for your code using pytest or other test framework you familiar with is a plus.
- Adding nginx configuration and supervisor is a plus.
- deploying the task on server is a plus. Using docker and docker compose with your application is also a plus.
