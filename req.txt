Using Django, Django Rest framework with MYSQL or PostgreSQL database, build a service with the following features:
    - User registration
    - User login
    - Package table in admin panel only
    - All users could add to subscribe to more than one package
    - Subscription by make order with one or more package

You are requested to:






1. Create simple Rest APIs endpoints for:
    - Registration
    - Login
    - Add Package model and show it in admin (product fields are: name, price)
    - Get Packages and the query should:
        - Order by price
        - search by name
    - create subscription with one or more packages
    - get user subscriptions

2. Use linter for your code (ex: flake8).






3. Add a Readme file containing instructions to run your code

Notes:
- The deadline for this task is Sunday, 14-10-2023, at 11:59 PM
- You are only asked to build the Rest APIs endpoints only (no templates). No GUI (no front-end) is required.
- Upload your code to a public Github repository and send the link of the repository.
- Use MYSQL or PostgreSQL as your main database.

- Adding simple test cases for your code using pytest or other test framework you familiar with is a plus.
- Adding nginx configuration and supervisor is a plus.
- deploying the task on server is a plus.
- Using docker and docker compose with your application is also a plus.

In case you have any questions, please send an email.
